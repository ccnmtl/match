<p>Pediatric dentists can partner with a variety of other healing and helping professionals to assure children's oral health, dental care, and overall wellbeing. Children's oral health is determined by social, behavioral, genetic, nutritional, and educational factors&mdash;as well as by dental care. Partnering with experts from these fields can enhance your practice and help children and their families obtain the highest levels of oral health.</p>

<p>These modules include activities, videos and case studies which:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Highlight non-dental professions that can impact children's oral health</li>
	<li>Suggest ways pediatric dentists can partner with them most effectively to enhance practice success</li>
	<li>Present examples of successful pediatric dentists who enhance their patient care through partnerships with these professions</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Please log in with your UNI or your project account ID to access these MATCH modules.</b></i>
