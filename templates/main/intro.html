<p>Pediatric dentists can partner with a variety of other healing and helping professionals to assure children’s oral health, dental care, and overall wellbeing.</p>
<p>
Children’s oral health is determined by social, behavioral, genetic, nutritional, and educational factors—as well as by dental care. Partnering with experts from these fields can enhance your practice and help children and their families obtain the highest levels of oral health. </p>

<div class='pullquote'>
<p>According to the US Surgeon General </p> 

<p>"Throughout the first two decades of growth and development, children and young people are deeply influenced by the social and environmental opportunities and constraints imposed by families, communities, and society. In the case of oral health, there is enough known about health promotion and disease prevention to improve the oral health and well-being of all children."</p>
