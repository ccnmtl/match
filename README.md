Match
==========

MATCH is five-year project to build a web-based resource for practicing and future pediatric dentists to learn how working with other health care professionals can enhance the services they provide to their patients. Pediatric dentists at times encounter issues relating to the wellbeing of their patients that are not directly related to oral health, such as evidence of abuse. The MATCH website will provide dentists with videos, example cases, and recommendations on how to build relationships with health professionals like social workers and pediatricians to deal with these issues when they arise and connect patients with the services they need. Each year of the project will focus on a different health care professional, adding resources related to working with individuals in that field.

This Django project was deprecated July 2017, and is not actively maintained.

A sustainable, static site was developed in Hugo to house the content and activities. Visit the new Match at <a href="http://match.ctl.columbia.edu">pass.ctl.columbia.edu</a>.
